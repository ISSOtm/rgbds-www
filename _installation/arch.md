# Installing RGBDS on Arch Linux

RGBDS is now available in the official repos as [`community/rgbds`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/rgbds/); you can also get the [latest master](/docs/master) via the [`rgbds-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rgbds-git) AUR package, or RGBDS 0.2.5 from [`rgbds2`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rgbds2), still from the AUR.

{% highlight bash %}
pacman -S rgbds
{% endhighlight %}

We refer you to the Arch Linux wiki on how to install [official packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Installing_packages) or [AUR packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_and_upgrading_packages), or to find and use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers).
